# Assignment 4 – Linear Regression

## Introduction
This repository contains my solution to Assignment 1, which focuses on creating and manipulating a data frame in R. In this assignment, I followed specific instructions to create a data frame, append an "age" column, and set up a GitHub repository for the project.

### Scenario One
You have been told that there is a correlation between coffee consumption and blood pressure. In order to statistically test the relationship you have collected data from 48 coffee drinkers, including the number of cups of coffee they have consumed and their blood pressures. Now you want to run a linear regression to see if there is any relationship between coffee consumption and blood pressure.

1. Find the correlation between coffee consumption and blood pressure using the scatter plot

2. Describe the relationship between coffee consumption and blood pressure and explain what someone should do if their doctor says that their blood pressure is a concern.

- It appears that there is a positive link between blood pressure and coffee consumption, as shown by the scatter plot. That is to say, systolic blood pressure tends to rise in parallel with the quantity of coffee a person drinks.

- If a patient’s doctor advises them that their blood pressure needs to be monitored, they should think about doing the following:

1. Reducing or decreasing caffeine intake from coffee and other sources may be helpful given the possible positive association between blood pressure and coffee consumption.
2. Seeing a healthcare provider: For a thorough assessment, those with high or worrisome blood pressure should definitely see a healthcare provider. If necessary, they can offer advice on medication, lifestyle modifications, or other therapies.
3. Lifestyle adjustments: A balanced diet, weight management, regular exercise, and stress reduction are just a few examples of lifestyle adjustments that can help control and lower blood pressure.

3. Train the model and predict the values for 8 and 6 cups of coffee in a day.

### Scenario Two
Bright Smile Corporation provides dental services to their clients. They have been in business for a number of years, but recently they have experienced competition from other dental service providers who provide mobile dental services to their clients. Mobile services are all about providing basic dental services at clients' homes. Bright Smile has a dilemma, as they are unsure if the mobile service is a good inversion and/or expansion.

1. Show a graph (scatter) with linear progression.

2. Analyze the data and add a regression line.

3. Predict the next two price points ($200 and $50).

5. Add both new values to the scatter linear graph.
